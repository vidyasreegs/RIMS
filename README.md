ABSTRACT

Remote Intelligent Monitoring System (RIMS)
This Project Aims to design a trouble free and systematic vehicle monitoring system, light automation and water level monitoring system. Where we are monitoring NIELIT campus main gate, Campus Street light and hostel water tank level. RIMS comprised of 3 stages,
 	Vehicle detection: - In secured areas, only the specified vehicles are allowed to enter. For this there should be an automated, monitoring system that accurately collects vehicle details and allows an easy in and out access for drivers. In our project we propose a completely automated monitoring vehicle entry at NIELIT campus using Raspberry Pi system. This stage aims at designing a system which captures vehicle image and extracts the number plate from the image and further these details are uploaded to the cloud for monitoring. 
Water level monitoring system: - It senses the level of water in the water tank, transfers the information using LoRa and updates the webserver which will be monitored continuously from security room and would be refilled in case of a notification when the level drops to 20%.     
 Automatic light control: - Automation of lights which will be switched on only during the dark hours and could be controlled from security room using LoRa transmitter and receiver in case of any emergency other than the specified time.
